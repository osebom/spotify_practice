This is a script to practice using the Spotify API through SpotiPy. It returns the top user tracks and the tracks from a specific playlist using the get_playlist_tracks and get_user_top_tracks functions. The API works by using the Client ID, Client Secret and Redirect URI to communicate with the Spotify API. When the first requested is made, the user is redirected to the URI to approve the requested permissions so the app they registered can access their data:
